Package: leela-warpdrive
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}, libffi5, zlib1g
Description: Scalable metrics monitoring engine
 Leela is a property-graph engine that allows storing properties as
 time-series, besides the usual key-value properties.
 .
 The graph engine is fairly simple and not intended to substitute real
 graph databases but to describe the relationship of the structure you
 are monitoring, such as a datacenter.
 .
 This package is the frontend the user usually connect to, exposing a
 zmq interface usually on port 4080.
