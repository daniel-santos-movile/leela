 Leela project
===============

Leela is a project that allows you to collect and plot any kind of
metrics.

Although it is inspired in `statsd <https://github.com/etsy/statsd/>`_
project [as such is following its protocol, loosely though], it has
deep architectural differences that we truly believe justify the
creation of another project.

This documentation is meant to be comprehensive from the user end
perspective. On the other hand, the developer guides are an overview
focusing on the architectural aspects rather than going deep in the
implementation details.
