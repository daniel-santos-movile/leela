 Leela project
===============

Leela is a project that allows you to collect and plot any kind of
metrics, following loosely the statsd [1]_ protocol.

Although it is inspired in statsd project, and as such is following
loosely its protocol, it has deep architectural differences that, we
believe, justify the creation of another project.

This documentation is meant to be a comprehensive from the user
perspective. On the other hand, the developer section is an overview
focusing on architectural aspects rather than going deep on
implementation aspects.
